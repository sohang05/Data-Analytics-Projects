# TACTICAL CRIME ANALYSIS

As part of FP20 Analytics Challenge 11, I have built a Tactical Crime Analysis Report for a law enforcement agency that will be used for crime data analysis from multiple dimensions.This report contains crime events, their dates, locations and types, and names, relationships, and demographic data of the involved parties. The aim of the challenge is to build interactive reports that can be used to resolve active cases, identify the relationships between suspects, victims and witnesses, and spot trends and patterns.

### Key insights:

 Violence and sexual offenses top the list, contrasting with less common incidents like possession of weapons and bicycle thefts.

 Notably, a higher concentration of crimes occurs during the evening and night, while mornings witness fewer incidents.

 Over 68% of the crimes involve males, providing valuable insights into gender patterns in criminal behavior.

 Ethnicity 1 is linked to a significant 37.84% of crimes, whereas ethnicity 8 has the lowest incidence at 0.001%.

 The majority of analyzed crimes took place in 2022, indicating a potential temporal trend demanding attention. 📊🔍📈
