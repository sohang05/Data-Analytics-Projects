## EDA On Engineering Graduate Salary Using Python

### Introduction

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a vital part of data science as it helps to discover relationships between the entities of the data we are working on. It is helpful to use EDA when we’re dealing with data for the first time. It also helps with large datasets as it is not practically possible to determine relationships with large unknown data. As we deep dive in EDA, we find various patterns which prove to be fruitful for further data processing and modeling.

In this article, we will try to uncover the factors that affect an Indian engineering graduate’s salary and subsequently select only relevant categories that have high impact on the salary. The cleaned data will be ready for any visualizations and to understand the factors that affect it.

**Dataset**
For this EDA, we will be using ‘Engineering Graduate Salary’ dataset available on Kaggle. It contains detailed information about the categories available in the data.
